# OssiaVoice
Ossia is an accessibility tool for those unable to speak or type; Ossia enables whole sentence creation with as few clicks as possible and targets <1 word typed per sentence.

Experience it for yourself at [ossiavoice.com](https://ossiavoice.com/)

## Currently Missing Features
- Switch control (and keyboard navigation) is sorely missing in the current version which is still in beta. The idea is to release Ossia in its current state to collect feedback and ideas while accessibilty is being better implemented. If you feel you can help with this please reach out
